# FireflySquadron
A strategy dogfight game.

The inspiration comes from a game which I forgot the name. It's basically a game where you command a bunch of fighters to fight with other spacecrafts. I remember it's a lot of fun, although it was very buggy.

This game I'm working on, is gonna be a strategy game with some management simulation in it. Hopefully it will turn out to be good.
